#NOTE

I am currently updating this gem to work with the Groupon v2 API and addressing several issues it has with newer rubies and Rails. Don't know if anyone else needs something like this, but we at Nest4Less do, so it is on the burner. Contact me with any questions, requests, or such.

# Groupon

Simple Ruby wrapper for the Groupon [API](http://sites.google.com/site/grouponapi/home). [Groupon](http://groupon.com) features the best deals and stuff to do in a growing number of major cities.

## Installation

    sudo gem install groupon
    
## Usage

You'll need a Groupon [API key](http://sites.google.com/site/grouponapi/home).

    require 'groupon'
    Groupon.api_key = 'your_key'
    
### Listing divisions

    divisions = Groupon.divisions
    
Groupon uses a [`Hashie::Mash`](http://github.com/intridea/hashie) for return values, providing a handy hash that supports dot notation:

    divisions.first.latitude
    => 35.0845
    divisions.first.name
    => "Albuquerque"
    
### Finding deals
    
    deals = Groupon.deals(:lat => 38.8339, :lng => -104.821)
    deals.first.conditions.minimum_purchase
    => 1
    
### Finding deals by division

    deals = Groupon.deals(:division => 'dallas')

## Changelog

### 0.0.1 - May 27, 2010

* Initial version

## How to contribute
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
